### Tuts+ Course: WebSocket Powered Rails Applications
**Instructor: Jos√© Mota**

Today's web applications demand real-time, low-latency data transfer. Users expect to interact with data as close to real-time as possible without minimizing the overall user experience. WebSockets allow you to do just that, by creating a persistent connection between a client and server that can be used to send data in real-time. In this course, you'll learn how to use the emerging WebSocket technology in a Ruby on Rails application. If you know the basics of Ruby on Rails and you're ready to see the power of using WebSockets, this is the course for you!
